# iserverd oscar mirror

This repo is a mirror of the, now unavailable (as of May 21, 2023), OSCAR docs at http://iserverd.khstu.ru/oscar/.

I found this documentation instrumental when developing [my own OSCAR server](https://github.com/ox/aim-oscar-server) and wanted to have an easily available mirror that I could navigate to continue development. The URL for this mirror is https://ox.github.io/iserverd-oscar-mirror/.
