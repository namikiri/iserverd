Subject:	IServerd config file (for V5 proto module)
============================================================================

# This option disable or enable V5 proto module.
V5 proto enabled	= 	Yes

# Maximum number of tries to retransmit packet if it lost.
# Server will try to retransmit packet specified times 
# and then delete it from confirm queue
V5 max retries		= 	3

# Timeout between retransmit packets. If packet is lost 
# server wait specified time and then resend expired packet 
V5 max timeout		=	2

# Time between keep-alive client packets. This (165) is
# standart value and you should remeber that if you increase 
# this - clone clients will not work - they often don't extract
# ping time from login reply packet
V5 ping time		=	165

# Maximum records for search result. V5 protocol haven't 
# internal limit in search, user can request search by name 
# doesn't containing 'sWERWW@#1' and he possibly receive 
# information about all server users. This search can easily 
# overload slow network (~300Kb/100 found users).
V5 max search		=	100

# Maximum message size (protocol top limit = 510 bytes).
V5 max msgsize		=	450

# V3 clients can send messages thru server up to 2025 bytes
# but V5 only 450 bytes. So IServerd split V3 message when 
# send it to V5 client. ICQ99 show last message first, 
# centerIcq first message first so you can select here 
# backward split order or forward
V3 msg split order	= backward
